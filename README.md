# Luna Free Games

This is my first attempt at making an integration for Home Assistant

The goal for this project is to be able to get a list of free claimable games from the luna website.

## THIS PROJECT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT OFFICIALLY WORKING YET!!!


1. To get started and add this github to your repo list (as an integration) in hacs
2. Then once to go your settings>devices then add new. search for Amazon Luna free games and add integration
3. Click submit and now you SHOULD have a list of free claimable games in a single sensor.

sensor.amazon_luna_free_games

games will be listed in the attributes.
